# Smart-O-Mat

Welcome to the source code of the `Smart-O-Mat`. The `Smart-O-Mat` is itself a rebuild of the `Wahl-O-Mat` but with improving the design and adding useful features, like:

- Sharing your results via a link
- Automatically saving your results in local storage
- Via current polls, showing parties fittingly to your answer which are going to be in the parliament
- A more simplistic approach (no Party selection view)

This is not the thought of a 100% replacement, I've just added the features I would need in a website like this. Also, the code of the `Wahl-O-Mat` is hideous which didn't make improving it easier!

## Issues

Please report any issues you encounter! I tried to convert the ugly data types of the `Wahl-O-Mat` to a more reasonable format found in [consts.ts](./src/lib/consts.ts) via some automatic scripts and snippets in [data/](./data/). There could be errors I've made because of the sheer amount of data I had to convert!
